# KaziLink Brand Guidelines

## Logo Concept

The KaziLink logo features a stylized 'K' integrated with three ascending bars, representing the career growth ladder:

1. **First Bar (Shortest)** - Attachments (Student level)
2. **Second Bar (Medium)** - Internships (Graduate level)

This visual metaphor communicates upward mobility and career progression.
